\***CLI Calculator App\***

1.Project Overview:

The CLI Calculator APP is a beginner Python project that allows users to perform basic Arithmetic Operations directly from the Terminal/Command Prompt. It supports Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, and Percentage Calculations.

This project helps in understanding:

* Python Functions.

* User Input/Output.

* Conditional Statements.

* Error handling (e.g., division by zero, invalid input).

* Creating reusable code in a Modular way.


2.Objective:

To build a \*\*Command-line Calculator\*\* using Python that:

* Runs in the Terminal.

* Accepts user input for two Numbers and an Operator.

* Performs the chosen Calculation and displays the result.

* Handles Input Errors Gracefully.

* Repeats until the user decides to exit.

3.Features:

* Addition

* Subtraction

* Multiplication

* Division (with division-by-zero protection)

* Percentage: calculates `(x / y) \* 100` as a percentage.

* Loop until user chooses to exit.

* Input validation and error handling.
